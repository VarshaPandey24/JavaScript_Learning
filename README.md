# JavaScript_Learning

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository! This repository is a collection of codes and projects that I have worked on daily to enhance my JavaScript skills, inspired by the YouTube channel Chai Aur Code by Hitesh Choudhary.

Introduction

This repository serves as a journal of my journey in learning JavaScript. Here, you will find various exercises, projects, and notes that I have compiled to improve my understanding of JavaScript. My aim is to complete the JavaScript series by June 15.

I am following the JavaScript series on the YouTube channel Chai Aur Code by Hitesh Choudhary. The series provides comprehensive tutorials and practical examples to learn JavaScript effectively.
Repository Structure
The repository is organized by video_No., with each directory representing whatever I learnt in that video. Inside each directory, you will find the code files and any related resources.
